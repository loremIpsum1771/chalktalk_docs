<h1>First-Time User&#8217;s Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#first-time-user-s-guide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This writeup is a first-time user&#8217;s guide on how to make sense of
ChalkTalk&#8217;s GUI-less GUI.</p>
<p>First, see the README on basic directions for installing and starting
ChalkTalk.  Also note the keyboard shortcuts for tips: &#8216;x&#8217; for
keyboard commands, or hold Space over an object or the background for
a list of possible commands.</p>
<p>Once you have ChalkTalk running and have drawn a few things, try
holding Space over the background.  You&#8217;ll see a radial menu of
possible commands.  These options are accessed by clicking once,
moving the mouse in the given direction, and clicking again.  Most of
ChalkTalk&#8217;s commands can be accessed by this kind of click-move-click
action.</p>
<p>For example, to zoom out on the whole ChalkTalk space, you can click
once on the background, move the mouse up, and (while on empty space)
click again.</p>
<p>Now try drawing a known object.  Draw a square, beginning from the
bottom-left and then going clockwise.  (As long as you start in that
corner and go clockwise, it can be a pretty ugly square and still
work.)  Then click once in the middle of your square.  It should morph
into a perfect-looking square.  Your sketch has now been recognized as
a Cube.</p>
<p>Okay, so let&#8217;s actually prove that it&#8217;s a cube.  Hold down the &#8216;r&#8217; key
while you have the mouse cursor over the square, then move the mouse.
You should now see the square rotate around to show a wireframe cube.</p>
<p>There are keyboard commands for rotate, scale, translate, and more,
but we can do all of this with just the mouse.  Hold down Space over
the cube to bring up the quick help menu.  All of the options shown
for the cube are done with a click-move-click action again, but this
time you&#8217;ll click outside the cube in the given direction and then
click on the cube itself.  Try it for rotation - click below the cube
once, then click on the cube, then move the mouse.  (Note that you
need to just click on the cube, not click-and-drag.)</p>
<p>Some smart objects will have more commands listed that are accessed by
dragging the mouse, or by using the &#8216;cmd&#8217; modifier.  Let&#8217;s try one of
those now on a bar chart.  First, bring up the dictionary of smart
objects by pressing &#8216;=&#8217;.  Look near the top-left of the list for
&#8216;barchartv&#8217;.  Click on it to create one, then click on the resulting
sketch to activate it as a smart sketch.</p>
<p>This gives us a nice one-bar chart, but usually the point of a bar
chart is to have more than one value.  Hold Space over the bar chart
to see the list of commands available.  You&#8217;ll see &#8216;cmd&#8217; to the
bottom-left.  The bar chart has a &#8220;Cmd-drag horizontally&#8221; feature to
create additional bars.  (It isn&#8217;t listed here, but it&#8217;s mentioned in
the source code for the object, which you can access by doing a
click-move-click action from the bottom-right.)  Cmd-drag is done by
doing a click-move-drag: click once below-and-left of the bar chart,
then click-and-drag on the bar chart and drag to the right.  Voila!
Lots of bars.</p>
<p>The bar chart can also be just clicked-and-dragged normally to adjust
the values of the bars.</p>
<p>Smart objects are great, but what really makes them powerful is that
we can hook them together.  Let&#8217;s try that with our new bar chart.
Find &#8216;face&#8217; in the list of smart objects and create one.  (You might
want to move objects around so that the face is sort of beside the bar
chart.)  Click on the face so that it&#8217;s activated.  This face can
actually be controlled by sending it numeric values, which it uses to
change expressive features such as the eyebrow position, mouth shape,
etc.</p>
<p>To connect the bar chart&#8217;s output to the face&#8217;s input, click to the
left of the bar chart and then click-and-drag from the middle of the
bar chart outwards.  You should see a curved line appear that follows
your mouse out from the chart.  Drag it over to the middle of the face
and then let go.  There should now be an arrow with an &#8216;x&#8217; in the
middle from the chart to the face.  Now try dragging the bars to
adjust their heights.  Make a face!</p>
<p>For the grand finale, there&#8217;s one more handy feature hiding inside the
bar chart object.  Make sure you have at least twelve bars in your bar
chart, and then do a Cmd-drag-down action on the bar chart to activate
the built-in noise function feature.  Enjoy!</p>
