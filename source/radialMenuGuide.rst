How to Use the Radial Menu
==========================

There are a number of options available for manipulating a sketch after it has been drawn, before and after it has been parsed. To view the set of options, hover the mouse over the object and hold the space bar. This action should cause a menu of options to appear surrounding the object. Each option is essentially a part of a wheel around the sketch. To select and apply an option, click the center of the sketch, then click in the same place where you saw the option in question, and then click back on the object to apply the option. See the list below for descriptions on the functionality of each option:
