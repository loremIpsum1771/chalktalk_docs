**How the documentation is organized**
--------------------------------------

    * For a walkthrough on how to get started with drawing sketches in chalktalk, see the users section. 

    * Topic guides discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.

    * Reference guides contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.

    * How-to guides are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how the software works.
