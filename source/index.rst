	This version of Chalktalk requires node.js to run.
	Here are the instructions for getting started:

	(1) Go to http://nodejs.org/download/ and download node.js

	(2) In the chalktalk/server folder, type:

		``npm install``

	(3) Now get back up out of the server folder, by typing the following:

	        ``cd ..``

	(4) Now you can run Chalktalk, by typing:

		``./run``

	Here are some useful things to know:

	To make Chrome run full-screen (the best way to run Chalktalk), use COMMAND-SHIFT-f

	To draw something, just drag your mouse.

	To see the hot keys menu and tool tips, hold down the SPACE key.

	To try creating your own sketch type, copy any of the files in
	the sketches/ folder to a new sketches/WHATEVER.js file.

	In your new file, change the value of this.label, and customize
	it to draw a different shape.
